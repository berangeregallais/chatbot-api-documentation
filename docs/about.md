# 📘 About This Documentation

*This documentation was created as part of a fictional project for portfolio purposes. It demonstrates technical writing and API documentation skills using industry-standard tools and practices.*

## 🎯 Purpose

This site showcases the structure and content of a developer-friendly API documentation using :

- **MkDocs** with the [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme  
- Multi-language **code samples** (JavaScript, Python, cURL)
- A custom **Playground** for testing endpoints
- Clear error handling and authentication workflows
- Realistic use cases, webhooks, and monitoring

## ✍️ What This Demonstrates

As a technical writer, this project highlights :

- Logical content architecture
- Clarity and precision in technical explanations
- Developer UX awareness
- API lifecycle documentation, from onboarding to troubleshooting
- Clean, modular organization in Markdown

## 🧪 Not Real, but Realistic

All endpoints, tokens, and business logic are **mocked** or **simulated**. No backend is running — this is purely static documentation designed to simulate a real-world API.
